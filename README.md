# Roadmap
Make our own IDE so that we can change more minor details to the themes. For example, Icon images, fancier borders, weird grey space by the opened files above hte editor, etc. 

# Contributing 
This code is just for fun, so feel free to do with it as you like. Refer to Installation and Support if help is needed.
These themes are designed for explicitly VS Code, so other IDE's will not support this.
