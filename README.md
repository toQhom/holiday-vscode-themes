# holiday-vscode-themes
A set of themes to make your VS Code more festive!

# Installation 
In order to use this code as a color theme for your Visual Studio Code, download the package from the theme you want and install the package on your device. Then in Visual Studio, go to File > Preferences > Color Theme and find the theme there.
Now you are ready to start coding for any festive season!

If you want to change the color schemes, all you have to do is download the folder of the theme you want and change the file under "themes", then package it using the Visual Studio Code Extension Generator.

# Roadmap
Make our own IDE so that we can change more minor details to the themes. For example, Icon images, fancier borders, weird grey space by the opened files above hte editor, etc. Fix some color schemes that make it difficult to read. Add compatibility with HTML, Markdown, and other languages.

# Contributing 
This code is just for fun, so feel free to do with it as you like. Refer to Installation and Support if help is needed.
These themes are designed for explicitly VS Code, so other IDE's will not support this.
